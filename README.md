**Cryptography:**

It is a method of storing and transmitting data in a particular form often codes (called as ciphertext) so that only those for whom it is intended can read and process it. 

**Cryptography Types:**



*   Symmetric Cryptography:

               It uses only one key to encrypt and decrypt (cipher and decipher) information.

               It is also called a  private key or secret key cryptography.

               Algorithms: DES, AES, Blowfish etc



*   Asymmetric Cryptography:

               It uses two keys for encryption and decryption.

               One private key and one public key

               It is also called public-key cryptography.

               Algorithms: RSA, DSA etc



*   Hash Functions:

            It doesn’t use any key.
            
            Encryption includes encryption and decryption process while hashing is a one-way process. 
            
            It uses fixed-length hash value which is computed as per the plain text. 
            
            It is impossible for the contents of the plain text to be recovered. 

            Algorithms: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2, SHA-3 etc
